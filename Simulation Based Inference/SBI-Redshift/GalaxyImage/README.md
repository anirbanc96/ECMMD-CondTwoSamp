# Experiment: Generate Images of Galaxy from `GalSim`

This folder contains the files for generating the galaxy images using `GalSim`. The experiment has been conducted using **Google Colab** with a **T4 GPU**.

## Folder Contents

- **Galaxy_Image.ipynb**: This notebook generate galaxy images from `GalSim`.
- **theta-pi4galaxy.png**: Galaxy image generated by `GalSim` with $\lambda = 0.75$ and $\alpha = -\frac{\pi}{4}$.
- **thetapi4galaxy.png**: Galaxy image generated by `GalSim` with $\lambda = 0.75$ and $\alpha = -\frac{\pi}{4}$.

## Dependencies

### Required Python Package

- **galsim**: The experiment requires the `galsim` package. This package is installed directly within the `Galaxy_Image.ipynb` notebook, so no additional installation steps are needed if you run the notebook as provided.

### External Script Dependency

- **GalSimData.py**: The `Galaxy_Image.ipynb` notebook relies on a script named `GalSimData.py`, which is located in the [Scripts](https://github.com/anirbanc96/ECMMD-CondTwoSamp/tree/main/Simulation%20Based%20Inference/SBI-Redshift/Scripts) folder in the previous directory. 

## How to Use

1. **Ensure Access to `GalSimData.py`**:
   - Before running the notebook, make sure the `GalSimData.py` script from the `Scripts` folder is accessible in the expected location

2. **Open `Galaxy_Image.ipynb`**:
   - Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or a local Jupyter environment to run the code.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the experiment. The notebook processes data, utilizes the `GalSimData.py` script, and generates the images `theta-pi4galaxy.png` and `thetapi4galaxy.png`.

## Notes

- The `galsim` package is installed within the notebook itself, ensuring that all dependencies are managed within the Colab or local environment.
- The images generated by the notebook are saved as `theta-pi4galaxy.png` and `thetapi4galaxy.png` and can be reviewed directly within this folder.
- If running the notebook outside of Google Colab, ensure that the `GalSimData.py` script is located in the correct relative path and that `galsim` is installed in your environment.
