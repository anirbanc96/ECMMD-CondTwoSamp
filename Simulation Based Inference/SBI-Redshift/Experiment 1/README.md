# Experiment: SBI-Redshift Over $\mu$

This folder contains all the necessary files for the experiment. The experiment has been conducted using **Google Colab** with a **T4 GPU**.

## Folder Contents

- **[SBI_Redshift_mu_Median_of_Difference.ipynb](https://github.com/anirbanc96/ECMMD-CondTwoSamp/blob/main/Simulation%20Based%20Inference/SBI-Redshift/Experiment%201/SBI_Redshift_mu_Median_of_Difference.ipynb)**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains the code for the experiment. This notebook generates the results.
- **plot_results.R**: An R script used to create a plot based on the data generated from the experiment.
- **plot.pdf**: A PDF file of the plot generated by the `plot_results.R` script.
- **data1.csv**: The first CSV file containing data produced by the experiment.
- **data2.csv**: The second CSV file containing data produced by the experiment.
- **data3.csv**: The third CSV file containing data produced by the experiment.
- **data4.csv**: The fourth CSV file containing data produced by the experiment.

## How to Use

### Running the Experiment

1. **Open `experiment.ipynb`**:
   - This notebook contains the main experiment. Open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or a local Jupyter environment to run the code.

2. **Package Requirement: `galsim`**:
   - The experiment requires the `galsim` package, which is installed directly within the notebook. No additional installation steps are necessary if you run the notebook as provided.

3. **Execute the Notebook**:
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the experiment. The notebook processes data and generates outputs, including the CSV files mentioned above.

### Plotting the Results

1. **Using the R Script**:
   - The `plot_results.R` script is used to create a plot based on the data from the experiment. This script requires an R environment.
   - You can run this script in an R-supported environment such as RStudio.

2. **Review the Plot**:
   - The generated plot is saved as `plot.pdf` and can be viewed directly. This file visualizes the data processed by the R script.

## Notes

- The `experiment.ipynb` notebook generates four CSV files (`data1.csv`, `data2.csv`, `data3.csv`, and `data4.csv`) that contain the output data from the experiment. These files are then used for further analysis and plotting.
- The `galsim` package is installed within the notebook and is necessary for running the experiment. Ensure the package is installed correctly if you plan to run the notebook outside of Google Colab.
- The R script is separate from the Jupyter notebook and requires an R environment to run. The plot it generates is saved as a PDF within this folder.
