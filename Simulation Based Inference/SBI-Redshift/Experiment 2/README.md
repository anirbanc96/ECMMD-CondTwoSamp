# Experiment: SBI-Redshift Over $n$ and $K$

This folder contains all the necessary files for the experiment. The experiment has been conducted using **Google Colab** with a **T4 GPU**.

## Folder Contents

- **[SBI_Redshift_mu05_median_of_difference.ipynb](https://github.com/anirbanc96/ECMMD-CondTwoSamp/blob/main/Simulation%20Based%20Inference/SBI-Redshift/Experiment%202/SBI_Redshift_mu05_median_of_difference.ipynb)**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains the code for the experiment. This notebook generates the results.
- **[Plotmu05.R](https://github.com/anirbanc96/ECMMD-CondTwoSamp/blob/main/Simulation%20Based%20Inference/SBI-Redshift/Experiment%202/Plotmu05.R)**: An R script used to create a plot based on the data generated from the experiment.
- **[Powerformu05.pdf](https://github.com/anirbanc96/ECMMD-CondTwoSamp/blob/main/Simulation%20Based%20Inference/SBI-Redshift/Experiment%202/Powerformu05.pdf)**: A PDF file of the plot generated by the `Plot.R` script.
- **powermu2205.csv**: The CSV file containing data produced by the experiment for $\mu=0.5$ and $n = 2500$ and $K=100$.
- **powermu2205_n2500_k50.csv**: The CSV file containing data produced by the experiment for $\mu=0.5$ and $n = 2500$ and $K=50$.
- **powermu2205_n1000_k100.csv**: The CSV file containing data produced by the experiment for $\mu=0.5$ and $n = 1000$ and $K=100$.
- **powermu2205_n1000_k50.csv**: The CSV file containing data produced by the experiment for $\mu=0.5$ and $n = 1000$ and $K=50$.

## How to Use

### Running the Experiment

1. **Open `SBI_Redshift_mu05_median_of_difference.ipynb`**:
   - This notebook contains the main experiment. Open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or a local Jupyter environment to run the code.
  
2. **Dependencies**

   - The `SBI_Redshift_mu05_median_of_difference.ipynb` notebook relies on Python scripts located in the [Scripts](https://github.com/anirbanc96/ECMMD-CondTwoSamp/tree/main/Simulation%20Based%20Inference/SBI-Redshift/Scripts) subfolder of the previous directory. These scripts are essential for the experiment and are expected to be available for the notebook.

3. **Package Requirement: `galsim`**:
   - The experiment requires the `galsim` package, which is installed directly within the notebook. No additional installation steps are necessary if you run the notebook as provided.

4. **Execute the Notebook**:
   - The notebook generates the CSV files mentioned above.

### Plotting the Results

1. **Using the R Script**:
   - The `Plot.R` script is used to create a plot based on the data from the experiment. This script requires an R environment.
   - You can run this script in an R-supported environment such as RStudio.

2. **Review the Plot**:
   - The generated plot is saved as `Plotmu05.pdf` and can be viewed directly. This file visualizes the data processed by the R script.

## Notes

- The `SBI_Redshift_mu05_median_of_difference.ipynb` notebook generates four CSV files (`powermu2205.csv`, `powermu2205_n2500_k50.csv`, `powermu2205_n1000_k100.csv`, and `powermu2205_n1000_k50.csv`) that contain the output data from the experiment. These files are then used for further analysis and plotting.
- The `galsim` package is installed within the notebook and is necessary for running the experiment. Ensure the package is installed correctly if you plan to run the notebook outside of Google Colab.
- The R script is separate from the Jupyter notebook and requires an R environment to run. The plot it generates is saved as a PDF within this folder.
