# Density Plots: Marginal Density Visualization

This folder contains an R script and images related to the visualization of marginal density at specific values of $\theta$ (theta). The script generates density plots at three different values of $\theta= -\frac{\pi}{3}, 0$ and $\frac{\pi}{3}$.

## Folder Contents

- **DensityPlots.R**: The R script that generates density plots of the marginal density for the specified values of Î¸.
- **zdensity_theta-pi3.pdf**: The density plot image for $\theta = -\frac{\pi}{3}$.
- **zdensity_theta0.pdf**: The density plot image for $\theta = 0$.
- **zdensity_thetapi3.pdf**: The density plot image for $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}$.

## Notes

- Ensure that your R environment has all the necessary packages installed to run `DensityPlots.R`. If any packages are required, they should be indicated at the top of the script.
- The generated plots are saved as `.pdf` files in this folder and can be viewed directly after running the script.
