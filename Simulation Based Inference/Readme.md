# Experiments in this Repository

This repository contains various experiments related to [your project/topic name]. All the experiments within this folder have been conducted in **Google Colab** using a **T4 GPU**.

## Getting Started

To run these experiments, you can either clone this repository and upload the necessary files to your own Google Colab environment, or you can use the following steps to get started directly in Google Colab:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Open Google Colab**:
    - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
    - Upload or open the `.ipynb` files from this repository.

3. **Select a T4 GPU**:
    - Go to **Runtime** > **Change runtime type**.
    - In the **Hardware accelerator** dropdown, select **GPU**.
    - Ensure that the **GPU type** is **T4** (Google Colab typically allocates this by default, but you can check in the session's hardware details).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/notebooks**: Contains all the Jupyter notebooks used for the experiments.
- **/data**: (If applicable) Contains datasets used in the experiments.
- **/models**: (If applicable) Contains saved models from the experiments.

## Requirements

Although all experiments are designed to run in Google Colab, you can also run them locally. The following Python packages are required:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the experiment)
- Other libraries as specified in the respective notebook.

## How to Use

1. Open any of the notebooks in the **/notebooks** directory.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to reproduce the experiments.
3. If needed, modify the notebook to test your own variations.

## Notes

- Each experiment is configured to run using a T4 GPU in Google Colab. Performance and results might vary if you run them on different hardware.
- Ensure that your Colab environment has access to the necessary resources before running any experiments.
